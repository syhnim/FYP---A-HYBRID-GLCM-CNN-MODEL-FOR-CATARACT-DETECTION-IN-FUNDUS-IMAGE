Title: "FYP - A Hybrid GLCM-CNN Model for Cataract Detection in Fundus Images"
The system was developed in the year 2023.

Objective:
Developed independently as my final year project, the aim is to enhance cataract detection in fundus images by leveraging a novel approach. The objective is to extract crucial information from each fundus image using five key features of the Grey-level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM): correlation, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, and contrast. This information is then fused with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to improve detection accuracy. The project evaluates the performance of the hybrid GLCM-CNN model against both CNN and a hybrid GLCM with k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) models.

Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from GitHub (owner: sjchoi98) and Kaggle (owner: JR2NGB), comprises a total of 1378 normal fundus images and 1038 cataract fundus images.

Methodology:
Implemented a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) to visualize accuracy metrics, predicted labels, and actual labels of three models for comparison: CNN, GLCM-k-NN & GLCM-CNN.

Future Improvements:
This project lays the foundation for future enhancements in cataract detection methodologies. Potential areas for improvement include refining the hybrid model architecture, expanding the dataset to encompass diverse fundus images, and exploring advanced image processing techniques to further boost accuracy and reliability.
